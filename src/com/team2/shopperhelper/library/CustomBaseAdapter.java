 *        Typically the ListView for Android will only show one value at a time.
 *        For our purposes, we need it to show the productName, price,
 *        inventoryCount, section, and aisle. In order to accommodate this, we
 *        are building a custom adapter to do so. What will happen is that the
 *        values for the POJO SearchResults will be passed into this class and
 *        it will list the items correctly.
 *        </p>
