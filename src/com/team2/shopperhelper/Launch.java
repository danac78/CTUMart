 *        This class is the initial activity that is launched when the icon is
 *        tapped on. It will direct itself into Search for Store, but it needs
 *        to check to ensure if that the Android OS is compatible (in case of
 *        Android OS corruption) and that it is connected to the Internet. If it
 *        loads with these two conditions being false, it will display a message
 *        alerting the user. Once they click on the ok button, the application
 *        will close. If both items are true, the user will just see Search
 *        Store appear. In the simulations ran, this actually only takes one
 *        second and the customer will not * notice these tests being conducted
 *        at all.
 *        </p>
