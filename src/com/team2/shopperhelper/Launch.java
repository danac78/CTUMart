 *            This class is the initial activity that is launched when the icon
 *            is tapped on. It will direct itself into Search for Store, but it
 *            needs to check to ensure if that the Android OS is compatible (in
 *            case of Android OS corruption) and that it is connected to the
 *            Internet. If it loads with these two conditions being false, it
 *            will display a message alerting the user. Once they click on the
 *            ok button, the application will close. If both items are true, the
 *            user will just see Search Store appear. In the simulations ran,
 *            this actually only takes one second and the customer will not
 * 
 *            notice these tests being conducted at all.
